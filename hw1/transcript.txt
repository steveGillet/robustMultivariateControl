Levente B (1/26/2025, 10:48:34 PM): Hi Steve! How can I help you today? 
Steve (1/26/2025, 10:49:55 PM): Hello Lenevie, sorry if that's spelled wrong but I can't see it very well. I had 2 submissions for my homework 1 on my RMC class one was before the deadline and one was after and the grader gave me a 0 for the late submission. Is there a way to see the first submission and what time it was submitted 
Steve (1/26/2025, 10:50:04 PM): I can't find that in the gradebook area 
Steve (1/26/2025, 10:50:39 PM): Levente 
Levente B (1/26/2025, 10:50:40 PM): Thank you for contacting Global Canvas Support! Could you please provide me the URL of the assignment? 
Steve (1/26/2025, 10:51:02 PM): https://canvas.colorado.edu/courses/113998/assignments/2296358 
Levente B (1/26/2025, 10:51:25 PM): Thank You! 
Levente B (1/26/2025, 10:55:15 PM): Thank you for your time! I checked the assignment and unfortunately the setting for the assignment is that students can only see the last attempt. But the instructor should be able to see both attempt 
Steve (1/26/2025, 10:56:12 PM): Interesting. Why would that even be an option smh. Okay, I will talk to the professor. Thanks for helping me out Levente. 
Levente B (1/26/2025, 10:56:25 PM): You welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with?
