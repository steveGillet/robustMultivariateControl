If G and K are square, invertible complex matrices, prove the following using the submultiplicative property $\bar  {\sigma }(GK) \leq \bar  {\sigma }(G)\bar  {\sigma }(K)$ of the matrix 2-norm, $\left \lVert \cdot \right \lVert _2 = \bar  {\sigma }(\cdot )$ and the identity $\bar  {\sigma }(G^{-1}) = \frac  {1}{\underline  {\sigma }(G)}$.
